# HackGT 5 - Dare to Venture
Precycle aims to inform and motivate users about recycling.  We utilized Google ML APIs to classify trash based on its correct bin.

This repository is partitioned into four components:
 - `android-social`, the social gamification interface to view recycling stats.
 - `android-kiosk`, the android UI for scanning litter items and checking scores.
 - `pi-interface`, the Raspberry Pi interface for lighting things up.
 - `server`, the server side of the code, running on an Azure instance.
