# HackGT 5 - Dare to Venture

This repository is partitioned into four components:
 - `android-social`, the social gamification interface to view recycling stats.
 - `android-kiosk`, the android UI for scanning litter items and checking scores.
 - `pi-interface`, the Raspberry Pi interface for lighting things up.
 - `server`, the server side of the code, running on an Azure instance.
